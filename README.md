# Integer Types in NumPy

This notebook explores and explains the handling of integer data types in Python's NumPy library. Its content is designed to provide a practical and theoretical introduction to integer types, their memory representation, and their behavior.

## Contents

### Introduction to Integer Types in NumPy
- Explanation of the nomenclature and representation of signed and unsigned integers.
- Comparison with data types in C/C++.

### Automatic Conversion of Python Integers
- Description of the behavior when converting Python integers to NumPy data types (such as `np.int32` or `np.int64`).

### Advantages of Fixed-Width Data Types in NumPy
- Efficiency in memory usage.
- Faster computation compared to Python integers.

### Behavior at Limit Values
- Explanation and examples of what happens when array values exceed the limits of the corresponding data type.

### Practical Examples
- Sample code demonstrating the representation and behavior of different integer types in NumPy.
